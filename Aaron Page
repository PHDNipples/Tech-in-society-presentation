        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence has had a major impact on society with the advancement of technology. The availability and ease of use of AI provide a potent combination that can easily lead to the misuse of AI in education.
        </p>

        <h2>CEO of OpenAI Sam Altman</h2>
        <p>
            CEO of OpenAI Sam Altman addressed concerns about the impact of AI on society, stating, "As this technology advances, we understand that people are anxious about how it could change the way we live."

            <br>
            <p>We can find that many answers to AI being abused in education is AI itself. With AI based plagiarism checkers. This however is ineffective. 

                <br><p>Using this link, we can manually type in a message, this AI based checker is likely to provide a false positive.

        <h2>History and Reasons for Advancement</h2>
        <p>
            In the discussion of the worst outcomes coming to fruition, it can be easy to pull the plug on the progression of technology. Tobias Baumann highlights the concerns of advancing technology, historical outcomes with similar factors, and provides an ethical perspective on the necessity of continuing technological advancement. 
            
        </p>

        <h2>Ministry of Education</h2>
        <p>
            The NZ Ministry of Education acknowledges that AI tools in education are still experimental, and the risks and potential harms are not well understood. When it comes to the view of the education sector, users (Teachers/Educators/Tertiary Entities). The general census is that AI is a tool that needs to be used with caution.  A direct quote from the NZ Ministry of education “These tools are still experimental and the risks and potential harms of these are still not well understood”<br><br>
            As it is highly unlikely that educational entities will have the skills to fully manage utilization of AI tools and have appropriate risk assessments, often entities will opt for a “No AI use” rule as this covers all potential risks, with the loss of a very powerful tool. <a href="https://gazette.education.govt.nz/articles/how-chatgpt-can-be-a-valuable-asset-to-education/">(Education Gazette editors, 2023)</a>

        <h2>Students' View</h2>
        <p>
            For students, the use of AI is complex, with varying levels of knowledge. Risks include 
            <div>
                <ul><li>plagiarism</li><br>
                    <li>data theft</li><br>
                    <li>AI dependency</li><br>
                    <li>propaganda.</li><br>
                </ul>
            </div> 
            Users must be cautious when using AI tools in their formal education.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Plagiarism:</strong> Users may utilize AI for their work and receive undeserved credit or be falsely accused of using AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>AI Dependency:</strong> Users may become overly reliant on AI, potentially hindering their own knowledge development.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Data Theft:</strong> The current lack of AI regulation can expose users to data theft risks.
